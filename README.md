# SQL Overview for Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company, is venturing into the online video rental service domain to remain competitive against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst in Rockbuster's Business Intelligence (BI) department, my primary task is to leverage SQL (Structured Query Language) for data analysis. SQL allows me to query Rockbuster's extensive database, enabling me to provide data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making.

## Key Questions and Objectives

Rockbuster's Management Board has posed critical business questions, ranging from revenue analysis to customer insights, that require data-driven answers. By harnessing SQL, I aim to address these questions comprehensively. My objectives include identifying top-performing movies, analyzing rental duration, understanding customer demographics, and exploring sales variations across geographic regions.

## Project Deliverables

Throughout the project, I'll generate deliverables in response to specific tasks, contributing to my final project. These deliverables will consist of SQL analyses, visualizations, and presentations tailored to address Rockbuster's business questions effectively. The final project will be evaluated based on my ability to craft moderately complex SQL queries, present results through compelling visualizations, and create a professional portfolio-worthy project.

## Learning Goals

My journey through this project will equip me with essential SQL skills, from database setup and data storage concepts to advanced querying techniques and data presentation. Each exercise focuses on specific learning objectives, such as understanding relational databases, mastering SQL syntax, querying data effectively, and creating insightful visualizations.

By the end of the project, I'll be proficient in using SQL to extract actionable insights from Rockbuster's data, empowering the company to make informed decisions and stay competitive in the evolving video rental market.
